# FlappyBird

This project uses NEAT to let an AI figure out how to play Flappy Bird. The game itself is built from scratch aside from images taken from the internet used for Flappy,
the pipes, the ground, and the background. Aside from the NEAT portion there is a main menu offering a Classic game mode for you to play the game on your won like the
good old days and of course the Bots mode to see the NEAT algorithm do its thing. There is a pause feature which allows you to unpause, restart and go back to the main menu.
